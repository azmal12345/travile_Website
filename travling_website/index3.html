                    <h1 id="Prime_customer">2. Who is the Data Protection Officer?</h1>
                    <p>
                        eDreams Prime is reserved for the use of individuals over 18 years old and is only for private and personal use, and cannot be used for business or professional purposes. Individuals acting in a business capacity as well as companies and/or legal entities are not allowed to purchase eDreams Prime or to benefit from it.
                        We reserve the right to immediately terminate your eDreams Prime in case of non-compliance with these T&Cs.
                        To purchase eDreams Prime, simply search and book a product on our Website or Application with the Prime Fare option selected. When conducting a search on our Website or Application, two fares will be displayed, the Prime Fare and the full fare. Selecting the Prime Fare and continuing to book that journey with that fare selected will result in offering to purchase a thirty (30) day free trial of eDreams Prime (the “Trial Period”) and availing of the Prime Fare as defined above.

If, after making the reservation, you can no longer travel for any reason and need to cancel or change your part of the reservation, the Prime Fare will no longer apply. In these circumstances, the difference between the Prime Fare and the price applicable to non-Prime customers at the date of changing the reservation will become due. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE CANCELLATION OF YOUR USER ACCOUNT DOES NOT ENTAIL THE CANCELLATION OR THE TERMINATION OF YOUREDREAMS PRIME AND THAT YOU ARE THE SOLE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE, PRESERVATION AND PRIVACY OF YOUR USER ACCOUNT AND CREDENTIALS.
                        You warrant that all information supplied by you on the Website or Application is true, accurate, current and complete and agree to keep your personal information correct and accurate (email address, contact details, etc.) by updating your User Account and/or informing the customer service department of any changes to your personal information via the process described in the Help Centre.

                    <h1 id="Payment">3. Why do we collect your personal data and which legal basis do we rely on?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Your eDreams Prime starts from the Effective Date and is valid initially for the Trial Period. You can cancel your free trial by contacting us as per the procedure below. <br>
                        IF YOU DO NOT CANCEL YOUR EDREAMS PRIME BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL PERIOD, IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AT THE END OF THE TRIAL PERIOD FOR AN ADDITIONAL PERIOD OF TWELVE (12) MONTHS (UNLESS TERMINATED BY US OR OTHERWISE INDICATED IN THESE T&Cs). <br>
                        YOUR EDREAMS PRIME WILL CONTINUE TO RENEW AUTOMATICALLY AT END OF EACH RENEWAL TERM (“RENEWAL DATE”) FOR ADDITIONAL TWELVE MONTH TERMS UNLESS YOU CANCEL. Each twelve month renewal period (a “Renewal Term”) and the Trial Period are separately and together referred to as the “Prime Term”. <br>
                        However, i In the case of certain promotions (for example, price reduction, etc.) you may have purchased an initial longer or shorter Prime Term (for instance, a Prime Term of 3 or 6 months, etc.). In those circumstances, you will become an eDreams Prime customer and may use eDreams Prime in accordance with the terms and conditions indicated in the promotion for that particular Prime Term. If you are unsure of the specific Prime Term that applies to you, your Confirmation Email will contain the relevant information, or you can contact us through our Help Centre or the Prime Line (details of which will be in the Confirmation Email). <br>
                        EACH PARTY MAY CANCEL THE SUBSCRIPTION BY PROVIDING THE OTHER PARTY WITH NOTICE AT LEAST 72 HOURS PRIOR THE END OF THE RESPECTIVE PRIME TERM STATING THAT THEY WISH TO CANCEL YOUR EDREAMS PRIME OR THAT THEY DO NOT WISH FOR IT TO RENEW AUTOMATICALLY. YOU CAN PROVIDE US THIS NOTICE BY ACCESSING YOUR USER ACCOUNT AND FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED THERE. <br>
                        The fee for your eDreams Prime (“Prime Fee”) is due and payable in advance of the start of any Prime Term which follows a Trial Period. IF YOU DO NOT CANCEL YOUR TRIAL PERIOD, YOUR PRIME FEE FOR THE RENEWAL TERM WILL BE DUE ON EXPIRY OF THE TRIAL PERIOD. <br>
                        YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR EDREAMS PRIME WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AND YOU AUTHORIZE US (WITHOUT FURTHER NOTICE TO YOU UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW) TO COLLECT THE PRIME FEE USING THE PAYMENT DETAILS REGISTERED TO YOUR ACCOUNT.
                        Storage of your bank data: we will use the payment details that you provided at the time of your purchase of eDreams Prime and creation of your User Account unless agreed otherwise between you and us.
                        You also agree that by purchasing eDreams Prime you accept that those payment details will also be used to collect the Prime Fee due for any subsequent Renewal Term. Should that payment method have expired on the Effective Date, we will ask you to provide up-to-date payment information in your User Account and/or if expired subsequently, ask you to enter up-to-date payment information in a dedicated renewal payment section of your User Account and/or, if applicable, we will apply those updated payment details provided to us in relation to any other booking that you have made during the Prime Term.
                        This shall apply any Renewal Terms.
                        PAYMENT DETAILS ENTERED MUST BELONG TO YOU. BY ENTERING THE PAYMENT DATA, YOU DECLARE THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE THEM AND ACCEPT SOLE RESPONSIBILITY FOR DOING SO.
                        You will only be entitled to benefit from eDreams Prime during the Prime Term and as long as the Prime Fee has been paid. Within the Prime Term, eDreams Prime is valid for all bookings as defined under Article 1 that you make on our Website or Application.
                        You can cancel eDreams Prime at any time during the Prime Term according to the instructions provided above. Note that the Prime Fee to eDreams Prime will not be refunded (except if you exercise your right to withdrawal as stated under Article 4).
                        The Prime Fee shall be considered the payment for a voucher with a par value equal to the Prime Fee (the “Prime Voucher”). The Prime Voucher shall be redeemed by you during the Prime Term when you make a booking on our Website and Application. The Prime Voucher is redeemed against the service fee charged by us for the handling of your booking with a maximum of the par value of the Prime Voucher. Therefore, we will not issue an invoice for the Prime Fee charged until the Prime Voucher is actually redeemed by you. Any unused portion of the Prime Voucher shall expire and shall not be entitled for refund or exchange for any products or further purchases.
                    </p>
                    <h1 id="withreaw">4. Which kind of personal data do we collect?</h1>
                    <p>
                        eDreams Prime becomes effective on the Effective Date as defined in Article 2 above. <br>
                        You benefit from a withdrawal period of 14 days from the Effective Date without giving any reason <b>(and is separate from your rights to cancel under Article 3)</b>. To meet the cancellation deadline, it is sufficient for you to communicate your decision to us by calling us on the Prime Line <b>(details will be in your Confirmation Email)</b> before the 14 day period has expired. <br>
                        If during that 14 day period you wish to exercise your right of withdrawal, we will reimburse to you the relevantPrime Fee received from you, but we may make a deduction from the reimbursement if you have already enjoyed the benefit of eDreams Prime by your express agreement <b>(i.e. by making a purchase with a Prime Fare)</b>. Such deduction shall correspond to the amount of any benefits provided by us up until we receive the communication of your decision to withdraw. Thus, any refund due following the exercise of your right of withdrawal will be impacted by any amount owed to us for benefits already received due to the execution of eDreams Prime, at your request. <br>
                        The refund by eDreams Prime will be made no later than 14 days from the date on which you informed us of your decision to withdraw.
